# Scientific Paper Summarization and Generation using the ArXiv Dataset

This project leverages the `scientific_papers` dataset (arXiv subset) to explore summarization and text generation techniques on scientific documents using Hugging Face Transformers.

## 📦 Dataset

- **Name**: `scientific_papers`
- **Subset**: `arxiv`
- **Source**: [AllenAI](https://allenai.org/)
- **Hosted on**: [Hugging Face Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/scientific_papers)
- **Fields**:
  - `article`: Full body of the scientific paper
  - `abstract`: Gold summary (typically written by the paper's authors)

> 🧠 Note: This dataset focuses on STEM fields like computer science, math, physics, and engineering. It does not include psychology, literature, or other humanities topics.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project includes:

- ✅ Loading and exploring the ArXiv dataset
- ✍️ Generating structured abstracts or paper sections using pretrained language models
- 🧪 Evaluating generation quality using ROUGE or BLEU metrics
- 🛠️ Fine-tuning language models on scientific content (optional)
